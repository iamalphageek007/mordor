# The Shire

This mordor environment is a small Windows environment supported by the [Simuland](https://github.com/OTRF/SimuLand) project. Simuland is an initiative from the Open Threat Research (OTR) community to share cloud templates and scripts to deploy network environments to simulate adversaries, generate/collect data and learn more about adversary tradecraft from a defensive perspective. The difference with other environments is that we do not have one scenario to cover all use-cases, but multiple modular environments that adapt to specific topics of research.

For more information about the environment go to the following [link](https://github.com/OTRF/SimuLand/tree/master/environments/windows/shire)
